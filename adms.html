      <h1>The Legal, Institutional and Technical Infrastructures of ADMS in India</h1>
      <h3>Law, Policies, Institutions and Actors</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>To understand the consequences of the use of ADMS and AI, it is imperative to explore the larger political, legal and institutional context within which its development and deployment is taking place. This section marks out the legal and institutional frameworks within which AI and ADMS are being adopted in India, and the policies and actors which are shaping the manner in which it is developed and deployed. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
      <p>Early examples of ADMS in India include systems like Eklavya, a software system which aided frontline child health workers with making decisions about diagnosis, health risk and future action for healthcare. Similarly, there is documented use of ‘Automated Legal Reasoning Systems’ under the Knowledge Based Computer Systems programme of the Government of India. These systems  implemented rule-based and logic-based programmes for decision-making, which were piloted in the fields of income tax, pension and customs. These systems attempted to encode the logic of statutory rules in these fields into programmatic computer languages.  These early examples are indicative of the Government of India’s desire to embed ADMS within government administration to ensure consistency in decision-making, and to assist the bureaucracy in navigating and administering complex rule-based systems. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>The contemporary use of Automated Decision Making Systems in India has continuities with this early history of using ‘AI’ and algorithmic logic use for consequential decisions. However, today, ADMS adoption is occurring in a very different technological and political context. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
      <p>Developing ‘AI’ and promoting computational data analytics within the government and the private sector alike has recently become a policy priority for the Government of India as well as various state governments over the last few years. Various ‘AI’ policies have been released by the Government of India – from the government policy agency NITI Aayog’s National Strategy for AI, to reports of expert committees constituted by the Ministry of IT – which see AI as a transformational technology, and as as a crucial ‘factor of production’ for higher economic growth. Government policy has explicitly called for greater development and adoption of ‘AI’ across the private and public sectors, ranging from healthcare to agriculture. The Department of Telecommunications has similarly articulated a vision for an ‘AI Stack’ – a technological architecture for AI as infrastructure to be used across a number of applications and domains. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>At the level of the State Governments, states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana have firmly committed themselves to the cause of promoting AI, reflected in documents like the ‘Tamil Nadu Safe and Ethical AI Policy’, or the Government of Telangana’s ‘2020 Year of AI Vision’</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
      <p>The vision of ‘AI’ articulated in these documents is one of a ‘public good’, championed by private firms and companies developing these technologies, and incentivised and legitimised by government investment, policy and ‘public-private partnerships’. This vision of AI has also influenced key regulatory and policy developments in India, particularly regarding the governance of digital data. Government policy documents, such as Economic Survey of India of 2018-2019, the Draft E-Commerce Policy and the Report of the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data, have attempted to reclassify ‘data’ within digital environments as an economic asset, whose value can be ‘unlocked’ or exploited through appropriately channeling them within AI or data analytics systems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>The policy focus on spurring innovation through the deployment of government regulation has had a direct influence on legislative policy as well. Early drafts of the Personal Data Protection Bill, in 2019, had carved out specific exemptions for activities like Credit Scoring and Fraud Detection, which are common use cases for ADMS. Similarly, the PDP Bill also allowed for the acquisition of any ‘non-personal’ data by the Government, for ‘better targetting’ of services or for the formulation of ‘evidence-based policy’ – once again evidencing attempts to use ‘big data analytics’ within ADMS to make consequential policy and administrative decisions. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>There has been an increasing recognition of the risks posed by delegating decision-making to automated systems and ‘AI’. Data protection and privacy are the key ‘risks’ identified within these policy documents. However, which are understood as primarily technological risks which can be allayed by appropriate technical standards such as anonymisation or through ‘consent management frameworks’. Some policy documents also speak to the need to ensure appropriate ‘ethical safeguards’, including the need to mitigate biases and unfairness caused by the applications of these systems. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
      <p>However, even as ‘AI’ policy which emerges from India recognises some risks and harms in the development and deployment of AI, there is a disturbing lack of recognition or regulation around the systems currently in use and being deployed’. As documented in this toolkit, many decisions consequential to individuals and communities are being delegated to algorithmic systems, varying in sophistication, but posing concerns – of democratic control, justice and self-determination – which are not reflected within policies which encourage the development and deployment of ‘AI’ systems. In fact, even in the documented deployment of AI and Machine Learning systems does not reflect the concerns of data protection, and ‘ethical development’ which is envisaged in policy documents at the ministerial level. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item grid-item-2">
      <p>Taking the gaze away from high-level policy documents on AI released by government agencies, the development of ADMS in India is being shaped, in fact, by a network of public and private actors, norms and institutions, seemingly unguided by the visions of ‘ethics’ or ‘social good’ articulated in policy documents. Instead, the development of these systems, is taking place in a regulatory vacuum, resulting in a situation where important considerations of transparency, accountability and democratic control are not given their due regard. The case studies below shine a light on actors and institutions responsible for ADMS in India.</p>
